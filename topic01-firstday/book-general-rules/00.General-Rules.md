# General Rules

A list of general rules all interns must adhere to


# In general common sense should prevail!

- This is a place of work and we have our own health, fire and safety rules which we will share and require all interns to follow.
- We do not have a formal dress code, casual clothes is best but tracksuits would not be appropriate. Hoodies are fine once they are tasteful.
- We have a canteen area and most people bring in their own lunch. We discourage leaving the office.
- We clean up after ourselves, cups/plates etc. in the dishwasher, rubbish in the bin.
- We have free tea/coffee/snacks program which everyone is respectful of and we do not overly abuse it. Itâ€™s not a substitute for lunch.
- The rules that you adhere to in school extend to the workplace. E.g. profanity, noise
level and have respect for peers and colleagues.
- We are customer facing at times and a zero tolerance approach will be taken any incidents that bring your school or Red Hat into disrepute.
- You will be provided with a laptop to work on but feel free to bring in your own.
- Laptops may be switched around or there may be a requirement to work on the same laptop as another student as part of an assignment.
- Laptops will have access to the internet which should only be used for work related
activities. Use of the internet for personal work is prohibited. Internet traffic is tracked and illegal activity or access banned sites will not be tolerated.
