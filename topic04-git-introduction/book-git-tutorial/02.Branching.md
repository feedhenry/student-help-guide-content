# Git Branching

----
## What is Branching?


This document is to show how branching works in git and how to use it. Branching is a feature available in git that lets you pull off from the master branch to make changes that won't directly effect the master branch unless merged. It also means that others have to review your work first just in case you have errors in your work such as spelling or bugs.

## Why Would You Use Branching

The main reason using different branches is so that you are not pushing to master. Pushing to master won't show any history bar the commit. 


## Creating a Branch.
Creating a branch is necessary if we want to make a push to the repo that you forked and are working on. Before we create a new branch we need to make sure we’re in the master branch. To switch between branches we use `git checkout <your-branch-name>`. To create a branch we use the command `git checkout -b <name your branch>` this should now create a new branch in the forked repo.

## Some Other Commands May Include:

```git branch -d <branch-name>```

Deletes the branch that you specify, but won't let you delete it if you have unmerged changes.

```git branch -D <branch-name>```

This will delete the branch regarless of whether you have unmerged changes or not.

```git branch -a```

Lists all the remote branches

```git branch -m <branch>```

Renames the branch to <branch>
