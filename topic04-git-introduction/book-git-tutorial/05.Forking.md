# Forking on GitHub

## What is forking?

To fork a repository means to get your own version/copy of the repository, and to be able to edit it without affecting the original repo (repository). 

## How to fork

* Go onto someone’s github profile
* Click on one of their repositories
* Then click the fork button which is usually located below your profile picture dropdown (see image)

Remember: You can’t fork your own repository!

## Why we fork

You may want to fork a repo to develop your own version of an existing project. Or if you are contributing to a project as a team using forks can be a good way to keep the original repository clean. i.e push feature branches to your fork rather than to origin.

## How to reference a fork

As we learned in previous sections you can clone (make a local copy) of any repository. If you have cloned and forked a repository you will want to tell the local copy where it can find the remote fork

First check which remote copies your local repository is already configured for using `git remote -v`

The output will look something like this:

```
origin	git@github.com:feedhenry/student-help-guide-content.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:feedhenry/student-help-guide-content.git (push)
```

`origin` refers to the name given to the repository locally.

To tell the local repository about an new remote (fork) simply run `git remote add <name> <ssh-address>`

Note: you can add the https address but as we have already set up ssh access in a previous lab let's use that.
